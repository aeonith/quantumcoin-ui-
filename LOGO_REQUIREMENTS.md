# QuantumCoin Logo Requirements for Trust Wallet

## Required Logo Specifications:

1. **File Format**: PNG with transparent background
2. **Size**: 256x256 pixels (required) and 512x512 pixels (recommended)
3. **File Name**: `logo.png`
4. **Quality**: High resolution, professional design
5. **Content**: Should represent QuantumCoin branding

## Design Guidelines:
- Clean, modern design
- Recognizable as cryptocurrency/blockchain related
- Quantum/technology themed elements (optional)
- Good contrast for both light and dark backgrounds
- Simple enough to be readable at small sizes

## Where to Place:
The logo file should be placed at:
`blockchains/ethereum/assets/0x[CONTRACT_ADDRESS]/logo.png`

## Important Note:
You must replace `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` with your actual deployed contract address when you have one.

## Current Status:
- ❌ Logo file missing - needs to be created
- ✅ info.json file created
- ⚠️  Contract address placeholder - needs real address
