# Deprecated JavaScript Prototypes

This directory contains early JavaScript prototypes that have been superseded by the production Rust implementation.

**These files are kept for historical reference only and should NOT be used in production.**

## Files Moved Here:
- `mining_ready_node.js` - Early JavaScript node prototype
- `real_quantumcoin_node.js` - JavaScript blockchain prototype
- `quick_node_server.js` - Development server prototype
- `simple_miner.js` - JavaScript miner prototype
- `real_miner.js` - Mining prototype
- `ai-sentinel/` - Experimental AI/ML module (removed for exchange compatibility)
- Various JavaScript utilities and testing scripts

## Production Implementation:
The official QuantumCoin implementation is now in Rust:
- **Node**: `crates/node/`
- **CLI**: `src/bin/`
- **Core Libraries**: `crates/`

## Migration Status:
✅ All JavaScript functionality has been ported to Rust
✅ JavaScript prototypes archived for reference
✅ Production builds use Rust implementation only
