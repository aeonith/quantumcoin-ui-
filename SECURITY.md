## Security Best Practices

### For Node Operators

#### System Security
```bash
# Run as non-root user
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false quantumcoin
sudo -u quantumcoin quantumcoin-node

# Enable firewall
ufw allow 8546/tcp  # P2P port
ufw allow 8545/tcp from 127.0.0.1  # RPC (local only)
ufw enable

# Keep system updated
apt update && apt upgrade
```

#### Network Security
```bash
# Use TLS for RPC connections
quantumcoin-node --rpc-tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem \
                 --rpc-tls-key /path/to/key.pem

# Bind RPC to localhost only (for security)
quantumcoin-node --rpc-bind 127.0.0.1:8545
```

#### Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor logs for suspicious activity
tail -f ~/.quantumcoin/node.log | grep -E "(error|warning|attack)"

# Set up alerts for unusual behavior
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -d '{"method":"getnetworkinfo"}' | \
  jq '.result.connections' | \
  awk '$1 < 3 { system("alert-low-peers.sh") }'
```

### For Exchange Operators

#### Cold Storage
```bash
# Generate cold wallet on air-gapped machine
qtc-wallet new --name exchange-cold --type cold --hsm

# Create unsigned transaction (online)
qtc-wallet send --wallet exchange-cold --offline \
  --to qtc1abc... --amount 1000.0

# Sign transaction (offline)
qtc-wallet sign --wallet exchange-cold \
  --transaction unsigned_tx.json

# Broadcast signed transaction (online)
qtc-wallet broadcast --file signed_tx.json
```

#### Hot Wallet Security
```bash
# Enable multi-signature for hot wallets
qtc-wallet new --name exchange-hot --type multisig \
  --threshold 3 --participants 5

# Use hardware security modules
qtc-wallet new --name exchange-hot --hsm

# Regular security audits
qtc-wallet audit --wallet exchange-hot
```

#### Monitoring & Alerts
```bash
# Monitor for large withdrawals
qtc-wallet history --wallet exchange-hot \
  --format json | \
  jq '.[] | select(.amount > 10000000000)' # > 100 QTC

# Verify supply integrity
supply-audit --verify --output daily-audit.json

# Alert on consensus issues
qtc-node status | grep -q "synchronized: true" || \
  alert-consensus-issue.sh
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed by at least 2 developers
- **Static Analysis**: Run `cargo clippy` and `cargo audit` on all code
- **Testing**: Maintain >90% test coverage for security-critical code
- **Fuzzing**: Use `cargo fuzz` for input validation testing

#### Dependencies
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies
- **Audit Dependencies**: Regular `cargo audit` checks
- **Pin Versions**: Use exact versions in production builds
- **Update Regularly**: Keep dependencies updated for security patches

#### Cryptography
- **Use Standard Libraries**: Never implement custom cryptography
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Use constant-time algorithms for sensitive operations
- **Secure Random**: Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- **Key Management**: Follow best practices for key generation and storage
